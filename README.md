# Bachelor-Project PassProof Password Checker
PassProof is a user-friendly, data-driven password checker designed to evaluate real-world password strength. Unlike most tools that rely on outdated complexity rules, PassProof analyzes structure, entropy, and real leaked data to give smarter, risk-based feedback — helping users build stronger and safer passwords.

✅ Real-time password strength scoring (0–100 scale)

📉 Pattern detection using leaked breach data

🔒 Shannon entropy calculation for randomness scoring

⚠️ Penalties for common passwords and predictable patterns

🧠 Personalized feedback messages to guide users

🌑 Modern GUI built with CustomTkinter (dark mode)

🛑 No passwords stored or transmitted — fully local
