# Bachelor-Project---PassProof-Password-Checker
PassProof is a user-friendly, data-driven password checker designed to evaluate real-world password strength. Unlike most tools that rely on outdated complexity rules, PassProof analyzes structure, entropy, and real leaked data to give smarter, risk-based feedback â€” helping users build stronger and safer passwords.
